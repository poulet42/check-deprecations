# check-deprecations

Scan a source file for calls to symbols tagged `@deprecated` in their JSDoc.

## Usage

```bash
check-deprecations <file>
```

If the binary is not on PATH, fall back to:

```bash
npx check-deprecations <file>
```

## Determining the file

- If the user supplied a path as an argument, use it.
- If there is an active editor selection or recently mentioned file, use that.
- Otherwise ask the user which file to check.

## Interpreting results

| Exit code | Meaning                                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`       | No deprecated usage — tell the user the file is clean.                |
| `1`       | Deprecated usage found — report each hit to the user.                 |
| `2`       | Error (file not found or missing argument) — relay the error message. |

Each hit is formatted as:

```
<file>:<line>:<col> - <message>
  <source line>
```

Report hits exactly as printed. If there are many, summarise the count and list them.
